<h3>THE SOLAR SYSTEM: SUN, PLANETS, STARS AND OTHER STARS</h3>
<h4>Facts about the solar system and the order of the planets:</h4>
<p>
  <img id="img1" src="imagenes/Sistemasolar.jpg" width="450" height="200" />
  <br />
  <br />
  -The solar system and its planets are found in the Milky Way Galaxy which, in
  turn, is located within a group of approximately 40 galaxies known as the
  Local Group.
  <br />
  <br />
  -To be more precise, the solar system is found in the Local Interstellar
  Cloud, located in the Local Bubble of the Orion Arm, within the Milky Way.
  <br />
  <br />
  -The solar system, which formed about 4.6 billion years ago, is a planetary
  group with only one known star: the Sun. This star contains more than 99% of
  the system's mass and is the only celestial body in the solar system capable
  of producing light of its own. All the planets and dwarf planets in the system
  revolve around it.
</p>
<h4>The planets that make up our system are 8:</h4>
<p>
  - Mercury.
  <br />
  - Venus.
  <br />
  - Earth.
  <br />
  - Mars.
  <br />
  - Jupiter.
  <br />
  - Saturn.
  <br />
  - Uranus.
  <br />
  - Neptune.
  <br />
  <br />
  Beyond Neptune we can find several dwarf planets, such as Pluto, which until
  2006 was considered the ninth planet of the solar system. But there are also
  Haumea, Makemake and Eris. There is also a dwarf planet between the orbits of
  Mars and Jupiter: Ceres. In the solar system, in addition to its planets and
  the Sun, we can also find hundreds of satellites (such as the Moon), thousands
  of comets and several asteroidal satellites among other celestial bodies.
</p>
<h4>The sun</h4>
<p>
  The Sun is the closest star to the Earth and is located at an average distance
  of 150 million kilometers. It is the main primary source of light and heat for
  the Earth. An analysis of its composition according to its mass establishes
  that it contains 71% Hydrogen, 27% Helium, and 2% of other heavier elements.

<h4>Solar structure</h4>
<h5>The Sun is made up of six main regions:</h5>
<p>
  <img id="img1" src="imagenes/regionessolares.jpg" width="400" height="250" />
  <br />
  <br />
  - The core: Contains 40% of the Sun's mass, less than 2% of the total volume,
  occupies a quarter of the solar radius, and generates 90% of its energy, in a
  thermonuclear fusion process in which hydrogen is transformed into helium. The
  hydrogen contained in the Sun's core is ionized as protons, which fuse to form
  helium atomic nuclei, releasing energy in the process. Its temperature is
  estimated at 15 million degrees Kelvin (째K) and its density at 150 gm/cm3.
</p>
<p>
  - The radiative zone: It surrounds the nucleus; It contains a gas so dense
  that the photons or electromagnetic radiation coming from the nucleus take
  hundreds of thousands of years to pass through this zone in order to reach the
  Sun's surface. The energy generated in the core diffuses through the radiative
  zone by atomic absorption and emission. Temperatures in this region reach
  130000 째K. This zone is located at a distance between 160000 km and 485000 km
  from the solar center.
</p>
<p>
  - Convective zone: It is a region with a lot of agitation where the plasma
  circulates and the gases ascend very hot, cool down and descend. This
  circulation is the main mechanism of energy transfer to the solar surface.
  These convective processes are observed on the surface of the Sun as small
  granules and supergranules in the form of 3000 km radius cells.
  <br />
  <br />
  <img id="img1" src="imagenes/size.jpg" width="450" height="200" />
</p>
<p>
  - The photosphere: It is the visible surface of the Sun; It surrounds the
  convective zone; It has a thickness of approximately 300 km, it is gaseous and
  of low density (10-8 g/cm3). Its gases are strongly ionized and have the
  capacity to absorb and emit radiation. Most of the solar radiation that
  reaches us comes from this layer, its temperature is close to 5800 째K. In this
  zone there are dark areas called sunspots, which are the coldest parts of the
  surface with temperatures of 3800 째K. Their size is similar to that of a
  planet; Intense magnetic ripples are present there. In this region there are
  also solar flares or solar eruptions, which are the most powerful explosions
  in the solar system. They have an explosive power equivalent to one hundred
  million hydrogen bombs and destroy everything near them, without leaving a
  single atom intact.
</p>
<p>
  - Chromosphere: Which is just above the photosphere, is a thin region of gas
  that is observed with a reddish-orange color, about 10000 km thick. It is
  essentially transparent to radiation emitted from the photosphere.
</p>
<p>
  - The Corona: Is the thin outer atmosphere composed of a halo, which is only
  seen during total solar eclipses.

</p>
<p>
  - Mercury: Mercury is made up of approximately 70% metallic elements and 30%
  silicates.
</p>
<p>
  - Venus: Carbon dioxide (96%), nitrogen (3%), water, sulfur gases (hydrogen
  sulfide and carbonyl sulfide) and noble gases (argon, xenon, neon and helium).
</p>
<p>
  - Earth: The atmosphere is composed mostly of Nitrogen (78%), Oxygen (20%) and
  Argon (0.93%), plus Neon, Helium, Krypton, Hydrogen, Nitrous Oxide and Xenon
  in a tiny amount.
</p>
<p>
  - Mars: Carbon dioxide (95.3%), Nitrogen (2.7%), Argon (1.7%), minor amounts
  of water, carbon monoxide and traces of noble gases such as neon and xenon.
</p>
<p>
  - Jupiter: is a gas giant, which means that its color depends on the clouds
  that make up its atmosphere. From space we can see two bands of orange and
  white that intermingle. Also some spots that are the violent storms that take
  place there, as is the case of the famous Great Red Spot.
</p>
<p>
  - Saturn: 93% hydrogen, 5% helium, 0.2% methane, 0.1% water vapor, and minor
  amounts of ammonia, ethane and phosphine.
</p>
<p>
  - Uranus: The composition of Uranus is 82.5% hydrogen, 15.2% helium, 2.3%
  methane and other gases in smaller proportions, such as hydrocarbons (from the
  photolysis of methane by solar ultraviolet rays) including ethane, acetylene,
  methyl-acetylene and polyacetylene. Other non-hydrocarbon gases that are also
  present in minute proportions are carbon dioxide, water, and carbon monoxide.
</p>
<p>
  - Neptune: Neptune is very similar to Uranus. It is composed of a thick
  mixture of water, ammonia, and methane over a solid center the size of the
  Earth. Its atmosphere is composed of hydrogen, helium, and methane.
</p>
<h5>Rocky planets</h5>
<p>
  There are four rocky planets in the Solar System: Mercury, Venus, Earth and
  Mars.
  <br />
  <br />
  The rocky planets receive this name because they have a composition rich in
  heavy elements where a small fraction is found in the gaseous atmosphere. On
  the contrary, the gaseous planets have a quantity of gas and a core composed
  of heavy elements and ices.
  <br />
  <br />
  <img id="img16" src="imagenes/rocky.jpg" width="450" height="200" />
</p>
<h5>Gas planets</h5>
<p>
  The gaseous planets of the solar system are Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and
  Neptune.
  <br />
  <br />
  The rocky planets are so called because they are not composed mostly of rock
  or other solid matter but of fluids and gigantic gas atmospheres surrounding
  relatively small rock cores.
  <br />
  <br />

</p>
<h4>Stars composition</h4>
<p>
  The chemical composition of stars is mostly hydrogen and helium in the gaseous
  state, and it is precisely these chemical elements that are responsible for
  their high energy and, therefore, their brightness. In addition, stars also
  have a small percentage of other chemical elements, which are also present in
  the rest of the universe. For example, small amounts of nitrogen, iron or
  carbon have also been recorded in the chemical composition of stars. Through
  nuclear fusion processes, stars consume hydrogen and transform it into helium.
  <br />
  As a result, they emit a large amount of chemical energy in the form of
  electromagnetic radiation. Most stars are too far away from us to reach us
  with little more than a flickering light, but we can clearly see the effects
  of this chemical energy in our nearest star, the Sun, whose energy gives us
  the light and heat necessary for life.
</p>
<h4>Asteroids composition</h4>
<p>
  Asteroids are not round like planets. They have jagged, irregular shapes. Some
  asteroids are hundreds of kilometers across, but most are as small as pebbles.
  Most are made of different types of rock, but some contain clay or metal, such
  as nickel and iron.
  <br />

</p>
<h4>Comets composition</h4>
<p>
  Comets are composed of gas, ice, and dust; they form in the spinning disk of
  material that surrounds a star when its planets are being born. They can seed
  new worlds with the chemicals essential for life and may have brought water to
  the nascent Earth.
