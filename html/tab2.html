<h2>Emission spectra</h2>
<h3>What is it?</h3>
<p>
  Is defined as the set of wavelengths emitted by an atom that is in an excited
  state. When emitting electromagnetic radiation, the exited atom passes to a
  lower energetic state.

<h3>What does it mean?</h3>
<p>
  Band emission spectra are produced by molecules that emit radiation in
  clusters of closely spaced lines that merge to form bands. These emission
  spectra contain much useful information about the structure and composition of
  matter.
</p>
<h3>What does it have to do with the electromagnetic spectrum?</h3>
<p>
  When we talk about the electromagnetic spectrum of an object, we refer to the
  different wavelengths that it emits (called emission spectrum) or absorbs
  (called absorption spectrum), thus generating a distribution of energy as a
  set of electromagnetic waves.

<h3>What does it have to do with chemistry?</h3>
<p>
  Each element in the periodic table has a unique emission spectrum known as a
  spectral signature. So that by analyzing the emission spectrum of a substance
  we can identify the elements that compose it.
  <br />
  <br />
  This procedure is called emission spectroscopy and is a very useful tool in
  various fields of science.
  <br />
  For example, it is used in chemical analysis and in astronomy to study the
  elements contained in a star.
</p>
<h3>How do you get the emission spectrum of a substance?</h3>
<p>
  When matter is excited by applying different sources of energy, thermal,
  electrical, nuclear or radiant, said matter usually relaxes and returns to its
  fundamental state, emitting electromagnetic radiation, giving rise to emission
  spectra.
