<h2>Absorption spectra</h2>
<h3>What is it?</h3>
<p>
  Spectrum presenting a sequence of frequencies, in a relatively wide interval,
  corresponding to the photons absorbed by a substance, generally representing
  the absorption coefficient as a function frequency or wavelength.
  <br />
  <br />
  =⇒ At the molecular level, the system undergoes a transition from a state of
  (lower) energy to one of (higher) energy Em, thanks to the energy of the
  photon (hv):
  <br />
  <br />
  $$A(En) + hν → A⋆(Em).$$

<h3>What does it mean?</h3>
<p>
  The absorption spectrum of a material shows the fraction of the incident
  electromagnetic radiation that a material absorbs within a range of
  frequencies. It is, in a sense, the opposite of an emission spectrum.
</p>
<h3>What does it have to do with the electromagnetic spectrum?</h3>
<p>
  The absorption spectrum is related to the electromagnetic spectrum as it is a
  graphical representation of the frequencies of radiation electromagnetic that
  are absorbed by a substance. In other words, an absorption spectrum shows the
  frequencies or wavelengths of light that are absorbed by a given material.
  These absorption frequencies are related to the transitions between different
  energy states of molecules or atoms that make up the material. Therefore, the
  absorption spectrum is an important tool used in spectroscopy, which is the
  study of the study of the interaction of light with matter. <br />
  On the other hand, the electromagnetic spectrum, represents the entire range
  of frequencies or wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation, from low-frequency
  radio waves to gamma rays. Both concepts are closely related in the physical
  explanation of the phenomena associated with the interaction of light with
  matter.
</p>
<h3>What does it have to do with chemistry?</h3>
<p>
  The absorption spectrum is a very useful analytical tool in chemistry. With
  it, chemists can determine properties and structures of molecules, atoms and
  compounds. By observing the absorption spectrum of a sample of material,
  chemists can identify which wavelengths of light are absorbed and by how much,
  allowing them to deduce information about the chemical structure of the
  sample. Therefore, absorption spectra are an important tool in analytical
  chemistry and in the investigation of structure and properties of molecules
  and chemical compounds.

<h3>How do you get the absorption spectra of a substance?</h3>
<p>
  The simplest approach to absorption spectroscopy is to generate radiation with
  a source, measure a reference spectrum of that radiation with a detector, and
  then re-measure the spectrum of the sample after placing the material of
  interest between the source and detector.

  Determine the composition of the stars by means of the absorption spectrum.
</h3>
<h4>Stars</h4>
<p>
  Absorption lines in stellar spectra can be used to determine the chemical
  composition of a star. Each element is responsible for a different set of
  absorption lines in the spectrum, at wavelengths that can be measured
  extremely reliably by laboratory experiments. Therefore, an absorption line at
  a particular wavelength in a stellar spectrum shows that element must be
  present. The absorption lines of hydrogen (found in the atmosphere of almost
  any star) are particularly important. The lines of hydrogen found within the
  visible spectrum are called Balmer lines.

<h4>Sun</h4>
<p>
  The absorption spectrum of the sun contains many lines corresponding to atomic
  elements and small molecules in a state outside the local thermodynamic
  equilibrium for which the corresponding calculations haven´t yet been obtained
  using quantum mechanics.

<h4>Planets and asteroids</h4>
<p>
  Planets and asteroids shine only by reflecting light from the Sun. The
  reflected light contains absorption bands due to minerals present in the rocks
  of rocky bodies, or elements and molecules present in the atmospheres of gas
  giants. Asteroids can be classified into three main types, according to their
  spectrum: C-type asteroids are composed of carbonaceous materials; S-type
  asteroids consist mainly of silicates; and M-type asteroids are 'metallic'. C-
  and S-type asteroids are the most common.

<h4>Comets</h4>
<p>
  The spectrum of comets consists of a solar spectrum reflected in the
  surrounding dust clouds, as well as emission lines formed when the solar wind
  collides with the gases surrounding the comet. Compositional analysis of
  comets has shown that they are made of virgin materials from the formative
  times of the solar system. Many organic compounds are known to exist in
  comets, and it has been suggested that cometary impacts may have provided
  Earth with much of the water in its oceans and the compounds necessary for the
  formation of life. It has been suggested that life may have been brought to
  Earth by comets from interstellar space (the Panspermia theory).
